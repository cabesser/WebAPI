# WebAPI
## Coding Challenge
Assumptions:  
1.  Based on the problem description of "Our users are science teachers who are highly computer literate and very familiar with using web-based tools" and the request to "Create a simple API/service to collect and grade worksheets" as well as the flexibility for designing the endpoints, this is a webservice created in Visual Studio C# whose controller can be tested with the unit tests but would require a webform added to it for running it from a browser.
2.  Since it was a simple API/service, no database was included for the actual storage of the results.

To run the application, download the repository and run the unit tests.  If you run it through the browser, it will simple return "Invalid" at this time.

The endpoints are:
1. double inputTemp
2. string inputUnit
3. string conversionUnit
4. double convertedTemp
